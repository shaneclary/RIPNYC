# RIP NEW YORK CITY — a Lennon Story

In the autumn of 1980, John Lennon walked around Manhattan in a plain white T-shirt that said **NEW YORK CITY** in tall, stacked block letters. No logo. No flourish. Just a direct statement of fact, rendered in the kind of unglamorous all-caps type you'd see on a street sign or a shipping label. It wasn't fashion. It was allegiance.

By then, Lennon had been living in the Dakota for several years, having traded the chaos of London and the weight of the Beatles for the anonymity and scale of New York. He loved the city with the intensity of a convert—loved its noise, its rudeness, its refusal to care who you were. "Nobody bothers you here," he said in interviews. "You can be whoever you want." For a man who'd spent his twenties as the most famous person on the planet, that freedom was sacred.

The shirt was just one of many he wore during this period—simple, typographic, declarative. Another said **ROOTS**. Another said nothing at all. He was dressing like a person, not a rock star. He was claiming space, not spectacle. And the city gave him that. It let him be.

Two months later, he was shot outside the Dakota by a man who had asked for his autograph earlier that same day.

The **RIP NEW YORK CITY** project begins with that shirt—not as imitation, but as inversion. Lennon's shirt said, *I am here. I belong here. This is my city.* Ours says, *I was there. It was real. It is gone.* Same typographic sincerity. Same plain-spoken geometry. But the tense has shifted. The city Lennon loved—the one that let you disappear, that didn't ask you to perform, that had room for strangeness and stillness and unbothered solitude—is largely gone. The forces that killed him (fame, obsession, the collapse of private life into public spectacle) have only intensified. The forces that protected him (anonymity, scale, a culture that let you be weird in peace) have mostly evaporated.

This is not about nostalgia. Nostalgia is soft. This is about *acknowledgment*—the difficult, necessary work of naming what has been lost so that you can see clearly what remains. And what remains is **you**. We remain. The ones who remember. The ones who carry it forward.

The **Lennon Cut**—the tall, stacked **RIP / NEW YORK / CITY** design—is the most direct piece in the collection. It is not trying to be clever. It is trying to be *clear*. It uses the same typographic vernacular Lennon used: tall, narrow, all-caps, centered, matter-of-fact. It feels like a broadside. It feels like a protest sign. It feels like a last will and testament.

But it is not the only piece. The collection includes six monument designs in total, each processing the same loss through a different emotional and aesthetic lens:

- **Old English** — Stark blackletter. Grief named. Resolve intact.
- **Timeless Fade** — A gradient from white to transparency. Permission to grieve and to hope.
- **Afterimage** — A crisp foreground with a soft echo. Memory as doubleness.
- **Brain Rot** — Glitched, scan-lined, chromatic. The noise of now.
- **Bangladesh Vibe** — Organic cotton, supply-chain candor, radical honesty.
- **Lennon Cut** — The one he never got to wear.

Each piece is a **monument**—a marker of time, a witness statement, a refusal to look away. They are not fashion in the traditional sense. They are acknowledgments. Timestamps in cloth. Quiet refusals to let what mattered disappear without being named.

We offer two production lines:

**Standard Drop** is on-demand, global supply. Fast, efficient, accessible. It uses the same print-on-demand networks that clothe most of the internet. It is not local. It does not pretend to be.

**USA Maker Line** is printed domestically, with the option of U.S.-made blanks. It costs more—because proximity costs more, because smaller runs cost more, because keeping production close to home in a globalized industry costs more. We are transparent about this. The premium reflects reality, not mythology.

The **Lennon Cut** is offered **only** via the USA line. This is intentional. It is a piece about place, about allegiance, about the weight of being *here*. Keeping its production domestic is part of the statement.

Lennon's **NEW YORK CITY** shirt was not merchandise. It was not a hustle. It was a plain declaration: *This is where I am. This is what I love.* The shirt didn't make him cool. His presence made the shirt matter.

We cannot replicate that. But we can honor the impulse: the desire to mark a moment, to claim a place, to refuse the pressure to move on before you've properly looked at what you're leaving behind. **RIP NEW YORK CITY** is not a celebration. It is not a concession. It is an **acknowledgment**—of loss, of continuity, of the stubborn fact that even when a city dies, the people who loved it remain.

You remain.

We remain.

These are the monuments we carry.
